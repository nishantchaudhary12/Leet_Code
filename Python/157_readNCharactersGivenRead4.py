'''Given a file and assume that you can only read the file using a given method read4, implement a method to read n characters.



Method read4:

The API read4 reads 4 consecutive characters from the file, then writes those characters into the buffer array buf.

The return value is the number of actual characters read.

Note that read4() has its own file pointer, much like FILE *fp in C.'''

"""
The read4 API is already defined for you.

    @param buf, a list of characters
    @return an integer
    def read4(buf):

# Below is an example of how the read4 API can be called.
file = File("abcdefghijk") # File is "abcdefghijk", initially file pointer (fp) points to 'a'
buf = [' '] * 4 # Create buffer with enough space to store characters
read4(buf) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['a','b','c','d'], fp points to 'e'
read4(buf) # read4 returns 4. Now buf = ['e','f','g','h'], fp points to 'i'
read4(buf) # read4 returns 3. Now buf = ['i','j','k',...], fp points to end of file
